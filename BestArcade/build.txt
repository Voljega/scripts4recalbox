If you want to build your own executable, it's pretty straightforward :
- Install your Python 3.3 environment (on Windows I use Anaconda)
- Launch python prompt (Anaconda prompt on Windows)
- Install pyinstaller with this command : `pip install pyinstaller`
- Go into the script dir and type : `pyinstaller -F BestArcade.py`
- Your exe will be generated into a `dist` subDirectory
- Just copy conf.conf, README.md, build.txt and data directory alongside the BestArcade exe and you're good to go
